# TS-Arrange2
A plugin for Typescript, which arranges elements within a class.

## Installation
On the extensions tab, search for *TS-Arrange2* and install it.

## Features
### Genal
This plugin arranges elements within a class by the following attributes attributes:
- Visibility
- Location (Static / Instance)
- Kind (Property, Field, Constructor)

### Sorting algorithm
- The sorting of the blocks is determinated by the TSLint rule __member-ordering__
- Within each element block, the members are ordered by their name
- Elements, which can't be associated, are set at the end of the class

## Limitations
The logic expects a member-ordering configuration with the exact declaration, for example:

```
"member-ordering": [
      true,
      {
        "order": [
          "public-static-field",
          "public-instance-field",
          "protected-static-field",
          "protected-instance-field",
          "private-static-field",
          "private-instance-field",
          "public-constructor",
          "protected-constructor",
          "private-constructor",
          "public-static-method",
          "public-instance-method",
          "protected-static-method",
          "protected-instance-method",
          "private-static-method",
          "private-instance-method"
        ]
      }
    ],
```
